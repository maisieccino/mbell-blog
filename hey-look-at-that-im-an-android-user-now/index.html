            <p>About four years ago, I was in the market for my next phone. I was after something mid-range, good value, a decent camera, and above all, a good OS. I was instantly wowed by the Windows Phone 7's inky black, silky smooth interface, and picked up a Nokia Lumia 800, rather than pick an average Android device. Android at the time was not very smooth to use on a lot of devices, and most manufacturers liked to add tonnes of bloatware onto their devices (the old TouchWiz being the most infamous of them all).</p>

<p>Windows Phone 7 users got a bit shafted though, when we found out that we wouldn't be getting an upgrade to Windows Phone 8. At this point my contract was due again. Should I pick a budget-to-midrange Android device, or Lumia 1020 which was being offered to me at a deal? I picked Windows again (for worse perhaps), since I wasn't that content with using a half-arsed low spec Samsung. The phone ran okay for most of the time, but since late last year started developing problems and even led me to missing lectures and <a href="https://blog.matthewb.me/windows-phone-is-broken-and-probably-dead/">other things</a>. So, a couple of weeks ago, I decided to give Android a proper chance.</p>

<p>I picked up the Motorola Moto G (3rd Generation) during a sale for Â£89 (RRP is Â£149), which was an absolute <em>steal</em>. It came with Android Lollipop (5.1) and has totally blown me away with how smooth the operating system has become. Even though the device is a <em>tad</em> underpowered (Snapdragon 410 and 1 GB RAM, anyone?), it can still run most things with ease and performs sublimely for what I was going to consider as a stop-gap phone to my next contract. The device feels excellent to hold, and the display is nice and bright - although it's "only" a 1280x720 pixel resolution. The battery life also lasts me a day, a far cry from the Lumia where I had to semi-permanently attach a USB cable to it.</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2016/06/Moto_G_Black_Front_Underwater.jpg" alt="Source: Motorola"></p>

<p>My only issues with the device so far is the lack of storage; the Moto G only has 8 GB of onboard memory and this is half consumed by Android itself, not leaving you with loads of room. Luckily, it does have a MicroSD card slot (also something new for me as Windows Phone never used to support this) so the memory is expandable by up to 32 GB I believe. Also, the Moto G <em>does</em> lack an NFC chip, although this isn't really an issue for me as most of the time it's just a battery drain and a nuisance.</p>

<p>Droid on! <br>
