            <p>Goddamn, people are not going to be quiet any time soon about this EU Referendum. But I mean, they do have a reason to. Whatever result we get, it's going to affect us (the young people) a lot more than it will affect older people, just for the fact that we'll be living and working for a longer time afterwards. So the clear thing I should say is that no matter what your view is, us under-30s <em>need</em> to get out to the polling station and vote.</p>

<p>It was a rather slimy move by the government to put the polls on the 23rd June- it's the time of year when over 100,000 teens will descend upon Somerset for the Glastonbury Festival so they'll need to remember to apply for a postal vote by at least half a month before the referendum (if I remember rightly). Also, the end of June is typically when all us students will be coming back from university, just to complicate things further. I'm going to be out of London and away from home on my internship by that time, so I've had to apply for postal vote. Amongst all the confusion about where you'll be, perhaps this would be the best method for you. Regardless, <strong>your deadline is the 7th of June to register!</strong> Find out more on the <a href="http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/">About My Vote</a> website.</p>

<p>Okay, onto the meat of the discussion. I rather boldly decided to clearly say in this blog title how I'm voting, and I'm expecting a <em>lot</em> of flaming as a result of it. Oops, soz. I kinda have a bone to pick with the coverage though, the BBC and the government are meant to be two impartial entities, but they've been making a lot of pro-EU media stuff, and although I agree with that sentiment, surely they should be weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of both In and Out? There are proper lies being made by both camps though, and to be honest, <strong>no one has any idea what's going to happen</strong>. Seriously, no one can time travel, and the success of an In vote or an Out vote depends entirely on 1) how our government handles it and 2) how other countries we trade with handle it.</p>

<p>So at the world politics level, it's all about countries shit-talking others. But let's look at a more personal level. In three years, I'll hopefully wearing a graduation gown, holding a transcript for a degree from one of the most prestigious universities in the world (probably). As well as being able to apply for work in any UK tech firm, I'd also have the ability to look for work in any of the countries inside the EU, and I wouldn't need to mess around with some messy visa or green cards. Fantastic! However, it concerns me that I may not have this ability if we were to leave the EU. Also, what's not to say that tech companies up sticks from the UK? Even though that's speculation, it does worry me that the industry I'm training to work in may break down and move elsewhere because of the reduced connections.</p>

<p>As well, it's not just me that would suffer at university. Currently, 17% of undergraduates at UCL come from the EU (<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/srs/statistics">Source: UCL</a>), and they're paying the same amount of tuition fees as UK students, which is Â£9000 per year. Non-EU students, for this course, will have to pay over Â£23,000 per year for the course, over twice as much! It saddens me to think that if we were to leave the EU, how many European students would turn down coming over here to study because of the excessively expensive degrees. But that's not all - our universities could potentially lose a collective one billion pounds in research funding if we leave the EU (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/18/uk_unis_could_lose_1bn_in_funding_if_they_leave_the_eu/">Source: The Register</a>), which would be crippling to the amount of research we do.</p>

<p>So yeah, I know I'm probably going to get a lot of vitriolic comments over this blog post, but I thought it was best to get my opinion out there, because I care a lot about the future. I personally feel like leaving the EU is cutting off the nose to spite the face, but I digress. However you feel, please please please make sure you register, like, now, before it's too late. Bell OUT.</p>
