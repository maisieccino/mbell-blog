            <p>I'm writing this from a coffee shop, rather than the nine o'clock lecture I'm meant to be in. Why? Because my phone didn't activate the alarms I set... again. This time it was because my phone was on silent mode. Really?! I set my phone to silent so that I wouldn't get disturbed by notifications in the night, and it muted the alarm too? A different problem happened on Saturday. I slept through my alarm and missed my very early train because it just so happened that Windows assumed that I "would not be busy" at that time and started applying a phone update.</p>

<p>It definitely seems like Windows Mobile 10 For Phones (the proper name for it) is two steps forwards, and a 100m sprint backwards for the underdog phone OS. Yes, I understand that as this is an 'insider preview', things should be broken, so why has Microsoft assumed that it is okay to preload their new phones with this build? You'd thing that if they were using it in production devices, then it'd be stable enough to use day to day. Right? It's worth noting before I get too ranty, that I have been using Windows Phone for four years now. I got shafted when Microsoft announced that WP7 devices would not be getting an upgrade to WP8, but I still got a Windows Phone 8 device mainly because of the extreme camera and good design.</p>

<p>For the most part, it is. I mean, if you can deal with the waiting. Seriously. Boot time has rocketed to about three or four minutes, and I think I spend most of my time on the device waiting for a "loading..." or "resuming..." screen to finish. Navigation is a joke and the phone frequently has problems acquiring a connection to GPS satellites. Spotify is unusable, and songs will literally just stop playing at random, as well as slowly consuming more and more of your devices limited storage. The Twitter app still lives in 2013, and the Instagram app actually hasn't been updated since 2013 (luckily, there's a third party app that is a whole order of magnitude better. 6tag is the name). Snapchat? Yik Yak? Your bank? Good luck finding them on the Windows Store. Unless you're banking with Barclays, who have a very well developed Windows app.</p>

<p>Microsoft were betting on Windows 10 attracting more developers to the platform by introducing the idea of Universal Windows Platform (UWP) - that all Windows 10 devices could be targeted using the exact same code. They hoped that developers and app makers would be tempted to tap into the massive market of desktop users and then created mobile apps as a result, but the truth is that for most computer users, you're probably going to just use your web browser. Also, Windows' market share is steadily being shrunk by the dominance of Apple and OSX. As much as it pains me to say, I would probably prefer to use a Mac because if you scrape away the Fischer Price interface, you actually have a UNIX system, which in my eyes earns it mad nerd cred. Even GNU/Linux is only UNIX-like, which means that it is essentially just like UNIX in most use cases.</p>

<p>So, I hate to say it Windows, but with your flailing mobile ecosystem and quickly vanishing desktop market share, you're dead son.</p>
